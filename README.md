Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
-Software engineering is a systematic collection of good program development practices and techniques.

(Mohapatra, H., & Rath, A. K. (2020). Fundamentals of Software Engineering. BPB Publications. http://books.google.ie/books?id=puPJDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Software+engineering+is+a+systematic+collection+of+good+program+development+practices+and+techniques.&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api)

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
-Software engineering is a systematic collection of good program development practices and techniques
-With the traditional approach, you‟re expected to move forward, gracefully from one phase to the other. With the modern
approach, on the other hand, you‟re allowed to perform each
phase more than once and in any order.
(Munassar, N. M. A., & Govardhan, A. (2011). Comparison between traditional approach and object-oriented approach in software engineering development. International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, 2(6).)

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
-Initiation Phase:-An organization establishes the need for a system and documents its purpose.

-Development/Acquisition Phase-During this phase, the system is designed, purchased, programmed, developed, or otherwise constructed.

-Implementation Phase. In the implementation phase, the organization configures and enables system security features, tests the functionality of these features, installs or implements the system, and obtains a formal authorization to operate the system.

-Operations/Maintenance Phase. In this phase, systems and products are in place and operating, enhancements and/or modifications to the system are developed and tested, and hardware and software components are added or replaced.

-Disposal Phase. In this phase, plans are developed for discarding system information, hardware, and software and making the transition to a new system.

(Radack, S. (2009). The system development life cycle (sdlc) (No. ITL Bulletin April 2009 (Withdrawn)). National Institute of Standards and Technology.)

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
- Water fall-Scope and processes need to be defined before starting the actual product development.It majorly focusses on processes hence where it is more preferred.
  Agile-There is limited time spent on planning before the first iteration is started. It focuses on end user value.

  Differences
1. Water fall- The initiating and planning stages are formal and take a lot of time to complete.
   Agile-Agile values customer collaboration over contract negotiation
2. Water fall- Project risk is High at the end of the project since this 
   is the point when the product is delivered to the market.
   Agile-Project risk is Low at the end of the project
   because a shippable increment is delivered with each iteration.

(Fagarasan, C., Popa, O., Pisla, A., & Cristea, C. (2021, August). Agile, waterfall and iterative approach in information technology projects. In IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering (Vol. 1169, No. 1, p. 012025). IOP Publishing.
)

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
- It is the systematic way of developing processes through an iterative co-operative process of analysing the problem, documenting the resulting obesrvation and checking the accuracy.
- The processes include the articulating the initial 
concept, problem analysis, feasibility and choice of options, analysis and modelling and requirements documentation. 

- The importance - It helps to identify the customers new needs and ways to satisfy them.
(Macaulay, L. A. (2012). Requirements engineering. Springer Science & Business Media.)


Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
- Modularity is a concept in software design which is most important due to its impact on software changeability and evolvability.

- It improves maintainability and scalability of software systems through:
Allowing independent modifications to modules, simplifying maintenance tasks.
Providing formalized, automatic testing and verification of design modularity, leading to precise, quantitative assessments.
Integrating design principles that support scalable architectures.
Ensuring that changes or expansions can be accommodated without disrupting the overall system.

(Cai, Y., Huynh, S., & Xie, T. (2007). A framework and tool supports for testing modularity of software design. Proceedings of the Twenty-Second IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering - ASE ’07. doi:10.1145/1321631.1321704)

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

- Unit Testing-It is a testing in which the smallest testable portion of the software is tested to verify its functionality against its specification. 
- Integration Testing-involves testing two or more combined units that must work together to ensure an error-free flow of control
and data (such as consistency of parameters, file format and so on) among combined units and their overall correct design and ntegration.
- System Testing-involves testing an integrated complete software to check against its compliance with its requirements. It verifies
the overall interaction of components to ensure the unanimous working of all modules and programs without error. 
- This testing is performed to validates the software against customer requirements. This testing is done to
ensure that the software does what the customer wants it to do and check the acceptability of the system.

Importance of Software Testing
Delivering quality software is the main goal of any software project. Software Testing has been widely used and remains a truly
effective means of assuring the quality of software. 

(Umar, M. A. (2019). Comprehensive study of software testing: Categories, levels, techniques, and types. International Journal of Advance Research, Ideas and Innovations in Technology, 5(6), 32-40.)

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

- Version Control Systems are systems that manages the development of an evolving object. 
- Importance
Improved Collaboration: Developers can work independently without conflicts, enhancing team productivity.

Comprehensive Change Tracking: Every modification is recorded with detailed information, aiding in project management and audit trails.

Efficient Versioning: Projects are versioned professionally, allowing easy retrieval of specific snapshots.

Enhanced Safety and Recovery: Previous versions are stored securely, enabling recovery from mistakes and facilitating comparative analysis.

Disk Space Conservation: Centralized management and efficient storage algorithms reduce disk space usage.

(Zolkifli, N. N., Ngah, A., & Deraman, A. (2018). Version control system: A review. Procedia Computer Science, 135, 408-415.)

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
- Facilitating-Clearing obstacles and issues, facilitating the project teams functioning, increasing process efficiency, and ensuring quality control
- Mentoring-Empowering the team on the path of self-organization, educating the team and stakeholders in agile practices, and ensuring team adherence to agile practices.
- Negotiating Negotiating project funding, issues, scope and commitment to work, with customers,
vendors and the development team.
- Coordinating Coordinating project logistics, such as release of deliverables and human capital, and coordinating collaboration
between the customers, teams and technical specialists.

(Shastri, Y., Hoda, R., & Amor, R. (2020). The role of the project manager in agile software development projects. Journal of Systems and Software, 110871. doi:10.1016/j.jss.2020.110871)

Challenges faced
- Undefined goals-At the point when territories are not clearly 
perceived, the whole arrangement and team can lament
- Changes in scopes-extend administration permits the venture's extension to
reach out past its unique goals. 
- Improper risk management-figuring out how to manage and get ready for
hazard is another vital bit of venture administration
preparing
- Impossible deadlines-An effective project manager realizes that more
than once approaching a group for the unimaginable
can rapidly bring about declining confidence and
efficiency. 

(Patil, G. (2016). Project management challenges. Journal of Multidisciplinary Engineering Science and Technology (JMEST), 3.)

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

- Software maintenance- defined as including all work made on a software system after it becomes operational. 
(Canfora, G., & Cimitile, A. (2001). Software maintenance. In Handbook of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering: Volume I: Fundamentals (pp. 91-120).)

- types of maintenance activities
Support interface - concerns changes in how information systems or technology personnel interact with stakeholders and others with respect to the software.
Training - common activities are presenting training to stakeholders about the system implemented by the software.
Consultive - common activities are making time and cost estimates for proposed maintenance work.
Evaluative - common activities are very diverse and include studying the source code and other documentation.
Reformative - common activities are improving the readability of the documentation modifying the documentation to incorporate the
effects of changes in the local standards manual.

(Chapin. (2000). Software maintenance types-a fresh view. Proceedings International Conference on Software Maintenance ICSM-94. doi:10.1109/icsm.2000.883056)

- Importance of software maintenance
Crucial for preserving software quality, usability, and relevance amidst evolving requirements and conditions.



Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Professionalism and Ethical Responsibility:

    Ethical Issue: The traditional separation between professional skills and ethical skills in engineering professions can lead to a lack of accountability and responsibility. Software engineers may prioritize technical proficiency over ethical considerations, potentially resulting in harmful or unethical outcomes.
    
Balancing Ethical Considerations with Technical Solutions:

    Ethical Issue: Software engineers often face situations where multiple technical solutions are available to address a problem. However, the ethical implications of these solutions may vary, and engineers may struggle to prioritize ethical considerations.
    

Consciousness and Awareness of Ethical Ramifications:

    Ethical Issue: Engineers may overlook or downplay the ethical implications of their decisions during the software development process, leading to unintended consequences or ethical dilemmas.
    
Impact on End-Product:

    Ethical Issue: While ethical considerations are important, they may not directly impact the end-product of software development. Engineers may question the practicality or effectiveness of integrating ethics into their work.
    

How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
- Integration: Merge ethical considerations into professional standards.
- EDSD: Implement Ethical-Driven Software Development for holistic ethical integration.
- Guiding Principles: Use ethical frameworks for informed decision-making at all development stages.
- Awareness: Raise consciousness of ethical implications throughout the process.
- Evaluation: Assess software solutions for alignment with ethical principles.
- Continuous Learning: Stay updated on evolving ethical standards through training and reflection.
